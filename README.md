# Automatic AIMS feedback filler
#### this repository consist of .py file which automatically fills the feedback form (using selenium)
#### .ipynb file is the code used to train deep learning model (made using pytorch) to read captcha
#### .pth file has the trained weights to read captcha
##### From analyzing the data of captcha I learned that in total there are 51 alphabets/numbers instead of 62
##### 26 lower case alphabets (a-z), 26 uppercase alphabets (A-Z) and 10 numbers (0-9) which sums to 62
##### I think this might be because of  similarity in the shape of some number and alphabets like 0(zero) & o

#### dataset available on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshdoshi/captcha-dataset
